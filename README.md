# 🔓 DIY Fingerprint Unlocker with ESP32 & R301T

Build your own fingerprint-based unlocking system using an ESP32 microcontroller and the R301T fingerprint sensor. This project walks you through wiring, programming, and deploying a biometric unlocker for devices like smartphones, laptops, or smart locks.

---

## 📦 Features

- Fingerprint enrollment and verification  
- Unlock signal triggered by verified fingerprint  
- Serial feedback for debugging and monitoring  
- Expandable for IoT and smart home integration  

---

## 🛠️ Hardware Required

- ESP32 development board  
- R301T fingerprint sensor  
- Jumper wires  
- Breadboard (optional)  
- Relay module or digital output device (for unlocking)

## 🔌 Wiring Guide

| R301T Pin | ESP32 Pin |
|-----------|-----------|
| VCC       | 3.3V      |
| GND       | GND       |
| TX        | RX (e.g., GPIO16) |
| RX        | TX (e.g., GPIO17) |

> Make sure to use a logic level converter if your ESP32 operates at 3.3V and the sensor expects 5V.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fingerprint-unlocker-esp32.git
   ```
2. Open `main.ino` in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO  
3. Install required libraries:
   - `Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor Library`
   - `HardwareSerial` (built-in for ESP32)
4. Upload the code to your ESP32  
5. Open Serial Monitor to enroll and verify fingerprints

## 📚 How It Works

- The ESP32 communicates with the R301T sensor via UART  
- Fingerprints are enrolled and stored in the sensor’s memory  
- When a fingerprint is scanned, it’s matched against stored templates  
- On successful match, the ESP32 sends a HIGH signal to unlock the device

## 🎯 Applications

- Laptop or phone unlock triggers  
- Secure access control systems  
- DIY biometric authentication for IoT projects
